                  borrow based on factors like your monthly income, credit status and affordability.
                  Other things come into play too, including your residence (homeowners are often preferred), age and
                  whether you have any other similar loans open too.

                  It can be trickier to get an emergency cash loan loan if you are unemployed, and it is usually more
                  difficult than getting a loan while you have steady income from a job.
                  However, for the 6.88 million unemployed US citizens there are alternatives to emergency cash loans,
                  such as Credit Union loans, which offer low APR rates of around 8.86%.
